# Java-Design-Patterns
This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Java. It showcases common solutions to recurring software design problems, helping developers understand and apply best practices in object-oriented programming. Each pattern is explained with clear examples and use cases to demonstrate its practical application.

## Design Patterns

### 1. SOLID Design Principles
- **[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](./Solid-Design/Single-Responsibility-Principle/)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility.
- **[Open Closed Principle (OCP)](./Solid-Design/Open-Closed-Principle/)**: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **[Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](./Solid-Design/Liskov-Substitution-Principle/)**: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
- **[Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](./Solid-Design/Interface-Segregation-Principle/)**: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use.
- **[Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./Solid-Design/Dependency-Inversion-Principle/)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.




### 2. Creational Design Patterns
- **[Builder Design Pattern](./Creational-Design-Pattern/Builder-Design-Pattern/)**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

- **[Simple Factory Design Pattern](./Creational-Design-Pattern/Simple-Factory-Pattern/)**: A simple Factory is a class with a static method that creates and returns instances of different classes based on input parameters. It encapsulates object creation logic & promotes centralized creation code, clean client code and separation of concerns.
